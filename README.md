# Tensor

Implementation of a simple PyTorch-esque 1D tensor in c

## Current Usage
Can perform `.view` operation

## To-Do
- Improve `.view()` operation, currently it reshapes the tensor similar to `.reshape` method in `NumPy`
- Add operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
